### My GitHub Pages
There are several GitHub repositories below for your reference as first step. I hope my works can help you to understand all those concepts and algorithms:

[ >>AI<< ](https://cheng-lin-li.github.io/AI/) includes my implementations of classical A.I. algorithms, like Alpha-Beta Pruning, Propositional Logic, and decision networks (Not yet complete).

[ >>Machine Learning<< ](https://cheng-lin-li.github.io/MachineLearning/) includes my implementations of machine learning algorithms, programs demostrate how to use scikit-learn, and tensorflow frameworks.

[ >>Spark<< ](https://cheng-lin-li.github.io/Spark/) include A-priori and SON, ALS with UV Decomposition, TF-IDF with K-Means, Matrix Multiplication by Two Phases approach, and Minhash and Locality-Sensitive Hash (LSH).

[ >>Information Visualization<< ](https://cheng-lin-li.github.io/InformationVisualization/) includes my codes for D3js, R, ggplot2.

[ >>Knowledge Graph<< ](https://cheng-lin-li.github.io/KnowledgeGraph/) include utilities programs like JSONLines package program, facebook crawler, information extraction, and a final project to combine all those techniques and machine learning algorithm to predict the trend of Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) in next day and next 30 day.

[ >>Neural Language Processing<< ](https://cheng-lin-li.github.io/Natural-Language-Processing/) include tagging program based on HMM-Viterbi with add one smoothing for transition probability, Good Turing smoothing / rule base algorithm for unknown words, Naive Bayes classifier for sentiment analysis of reviews. (under constructing).
