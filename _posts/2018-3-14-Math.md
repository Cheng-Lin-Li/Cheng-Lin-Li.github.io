### Math is the foundation of science
Mathematics is the foundation of science, you may need to review below areas if you really want to be an expert of a data scientist. There are so many easy to use packages, libraries, examples to help us on macine learning, natural language processing development. The real question: what is the right model / algorithm I have to choose? How do you know the algorithm, model fit into your questions?

The answer is to know about the assumption of each model and algorithm. The understanding about math in below areas will definitely give you a hand to fully understand those assumptions. You will not only know how but also why you choose the model to deal with your own questions.

There are suggesting topics you may need know (maybe in the future).
1. Calculus
