[You can view my Colaboratory Notebook template with steps from here](https://github.com/Cheng-Lin-Li/Cheng-Lin-Li.github.io/blob/master/resources/2018-04-04/GoogleColaboratoryNotebookTemplate.ipynb) or you want to [download this google colaboratory notebook template directly](https://cdn.rawgit.com/Cheng-Lin-Li/Cheng-Lin-Li.github.io/master/resources/2018-04-04/GoogleColaboratoryNotebookTemplate.ipynb).

An interesting toy for the new learner of machine learning.

This documentation is focus on some tips by my personal experience to share with others who just want to start their trials.

## Why do we need GPU?
### High dimensional computions are major operations in deep learning models.

## What is Google Colaboratory?


## How does it works?


### Pro
1. The GPU resource is free.
2. The environment is well integrated with major machine learning packages.


### Con
1. RAM is limited.
2. Connection time is limited.

## How does it work with google drive?

### Mount google drive into virtual machine of Colaboratory.

### Get data from google drive to colaboratory.

### Save your model parameters into files.

### Load your model parameters from local files.

### Copy data from colaboratory to google drive.



The document is still under constructing, you may refer below comprehensive reference for details.
